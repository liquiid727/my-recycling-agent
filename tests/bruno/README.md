# Bruno

HTTP collection and scenario assets generated from accepted specs belong here.

Bruno outputs should be treated as execution assets. The independent test console should read normalized files from `tests/results/` instead of parsing Bruno-native output directly.

Generate a collection from a normalized test plan:

```bash
node packages/cli/dist/main.js generate-bruno-tests <specId>
```

Generated files live under `tests/bruno/<specId>/` and include `bruno.json`, one `.bru` request per endpoint, and a collection README.

## Runner Contract

`specos run-api-tests <specId>` expects API execution assets under:

```text
tests/bruno/<specId>/
```

When assets or execution adapter configuration are missing, the runner writes a blocked normalized result instead of reporting success.

Bind a real Bruno command with:

```bash
node packages/cli/dist/main.js run-api-tests <specId> --command "bru run tests/bruno/<specId>"
```

The command is executed from the project root. Exit code `0` is normalized as pass/ready; any other exit code is normalized as warning/blocked.
